# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains an AirBnB clone project - a simplified web application that mimics some of the core functionalities of the popular accommodation rental platform, AirBnB.

## Project Goals
- Develop a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects
- Implement a base class for all models in the system
- Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization
- Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, Place, State, City, etc.)
- Create an abstracted storage engine
- Develop unit tests to validate all classes and storage engine

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python
- **Database**: File storage (JSON) initially, with plans to transition to MySQL
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (in later phases)
- **Testing**: Python unittest framework

## Project Timeline
This project will be developed incrementally with multiple phases, starting with a command-line interface and eventually building up to a fully functional web application.

## Team Roles
Here's a breakdown of the key roles and responsibilities within our project team:

### Project Manager
- Oversees the entire project lifecycle
- Creates and maintains the project roadmap
- Ensures deliverables are completed on time
- Facilitates communication between team members
- Identifies and mitigates project risks

### Backend Developer
- Implements the command interpreter functionality
- Develops the object models (User, Place, State, City, etc.)
- Creates the storage engine and serialization/deserialization methods
- Writes unit tests for backend components
- Ensures data integrity and security

### Database Administrator
- Designs the database schema
- Implements the file storage system
- Plans for future migration to MySQL
- Optimizes data access patterns
- Ensures data persistence and recovery mechanisms

### Frontend Developer
- Designs and implements the user interface
- Creates responsive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Ensures cross-browser compatibility
- Implements user interaction features
- Connects the frontend with the backend API

### Quality Assurance Engineer
- Develops and executes test plans
- Identifies and documents bugs
- Performs regression testing
- Validates that the application meets requirements
- Ensures overall code quality and performance

### DevOps Engineer
- Sets up the development, testing, and production environments
- Implements continuous integration and deployment pipelines
- Manages version control systems
- Handles server configuration and maintenance
- Monitors application performance and availability

Each role is crucial for the successful implementation of the AirBnB clone project, and team members may take on multiple roles depending on the phase of the project.

## Technology Stack

Here's a detailed breakdown of the technology stack used in our AirBnB clone project:

### Python
- **Purpose**: Core programming language for backend development
- **Usage**: Implements the command interpreter, models, and business logic
- **Benefits**: Strong typing, extensive libraries, and excellent for object-oriented programming

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- **Purpose**: Data interchange format for storage
- **Usage**: Serializes and deserializes Python objects for persistency
- **Benefits**: Lightweight, human-readable, and language-independent

### MySQL
- **Purpose**: Relational database management system (planned for later phases)
- **Usage**: Will store structured data for users, places, reviews, etc.
- **Benefits**: ACID compliance, strong data integrity, and robust query capabilities

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- **Purpose**: Standard markup language for web pages
- **Usage**: Defines the structure and content of web pages
- **Benefits**: Universal browser support and semantic structure

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- **Purpose**: Style sheet language for presentation
- **Usage**: Designs the visual layout and aesthetics of web pages
- **Benefits**: Separation of content and presentation, responsive design capabilities

### JavaScript
- **Purpose**: Programming language for web interactivity
- **Usage**: Implements dynamic features and user interactions
- **Benefits**: Client-side execution, asynchronous programming, and DOM manipulation

### Unittest Framework
- **Purpose**: Python's built-in testing framework
- **Usage**: Tests the functionality of classes, methods, and features
- **Benefits**: Automated testing, test discovery, and test organization
