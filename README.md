# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains an AirBnB clone project - a simplified web application that mimics some of the core functionalities of the popular accommodation rental platform, AirBnB.

## Project Goals
- Develop a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects
- Implement a base class for all models in the system
- Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization
- Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, Place, State, City, etc.)
- Create an abstracted storage engine
- Develop unit tests to validate all classes and storage engine

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python
- **Database**: File storage (JSON) initially, with plans to transition to MySQL
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (in later phases)
- **Testing**: Python unittest framework

## Project Timeline
This project will be developed incrementally with multiple phases, starting with a command-line interface and eventually building up to a fully functional web application.
